This project is a fork of [Satsuma](http://satsumagraph.sourceforge.net/doc/html/), a C# graph library I found on sourceforge. I created this fork because:

 * Satsuma is easy to use and setup so I want it to be available
 * I found some bugs in satsuma, but there was no way to contribute fixes
 * I want future users to benefit from my bug fixes.
